Using the above management system, you are required to help the school answer the below questions. For each of the questions, we have the following time complexity.  
1. Which three books have been issued the greatest number of times? 
Ans: It will take O(n) time complexity as the traverse the  nodes in the tree. We are storing the data in a dictionary, and then sorting the data. Sorting the data takes again O(n). Total time complexity  is O(n+n) which is equal to O(2n) . This can be reduced to O(n) as the final time complexity for this method. 
2. Which books do not have any more copies left in the library (all copies have been issued)?
Ans:  O(n) time complexity As it takes traverse the whole tree
3. Find out if a particular book is available in the library based on the book id. 
Ans: O(log(n)) time complexity as we are searching for a particular book id and not traversing the whole tree. 
4. Out of the entire set of books in the library, list the books that have never been checked out
by students?
Ans: O(n) time complexity, as we need to traverse the whole tree. 
5. Print a list of all the books and available copies. 
Ans: O(n) time complexity, as we need to traverse the whole tree.
